                    On 19 August 1950, Sudha Murthy was born in a Brahmin family in Shiggaon, Karnataka. Her father Dr R.H. Kulkarni who was a surgeon and her mother Vimala Kulkarni supported her in her endeavours right from her childhood and raised young Sudha along with her three siblings. An educated atmosphere in the family instilled in her a passion to do something extraordinary at an early age.

Her early life experiences and affinity to her grandmother became the foundation for some of her books.
